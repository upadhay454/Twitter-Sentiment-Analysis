The painting is ugly, will return it tomorrow...
Too early to travel..need a coffee
Damn..the train is late again...
Bad news, my flight just got cancelled.
Had a bad evening, need urgently a beer.
I put on weight again
I lost my keys
I hate Mondays
He killed our good mood
The dark side of a selfie.
False hopes for the people attending the meeting
The ugliest car ever!
Feeling bored
Need urgently a pause
I didn't see that one coming
Sorry mate, there is no more room for you
Who could have possibly done this?
I feel bad for what I did		
I just did a big mistake
I never loved so hard in my life
I hate you Mike!!
I hate to say goodbye
Never try this at home
Don't spoil it!
The more I hear you, the more annoyed I get
I just lost my appetite
Sad end for this movie
Lonely, I am so lonely
Hate to wait on a long queue		
No cab available
Electricity outage, this is a nightmare
Nobody to ask about directions
I feel sick
I am very tired
Such a bad taste
I don't recommend this restaurant
I will never ever call you again
I just got kicked out of the contest
Big pain to see my team loosing
Bitter defeat tonight
My bike was stollen
I lost every hope for seeing him again
Cold winter ahead
Hopless struggle..


Ugly hat
